# Testing using ioConnect sdk to generate JWK (used to create DIDs) from private key

This is just using a cloned ioConnect repo, with modified `example/linux/deviceregister` directory, to test creating DID from an input private key.

Can build by _mostly_ following the README in `example/linux/deviceregister`.
